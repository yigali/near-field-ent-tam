There are 5 folders, each for the corresponding part in the manuscript: Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Supplementary Material. Below are the contents of each folder:  

Fig1/Code: Matlab code for em field projection calculation.  
Fig2/Code: Matlab code used to read specific areas of *.tiff images for the Figure 2 in the manuscript.  
Fig2/tam1_sum & Fig2/tamm1_sum: Images of modes displayed in Figure 2 in the manuscript, tam1 (tamm1) stands for total angular momentum of (minus) 1.  
Fig3/Code: Matlab code used to calculate correlations & distribution of correlations.  
Fig3/Data: Experimental data in Matlab format.  
Fig4/Code: Python code used to calculate the fidelity between the predicted and experimentally obtained density matrix, including error analysis using bootstrapping.  
Fig4/Data: Experimental data in Matlab format.  
Supplementary: Python code used for numerical analysis of EPR and entanglement witness criterias.
